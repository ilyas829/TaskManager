Task Manager Application - Test Plan and Strategy Document
1. Executive Summary
This document outlines the comprehensive testing strategy for the Task Manager web application, a full-stack React/Node.js application with automated UI and API testing capabilities. The testing approach covers multiple layers including unit tests, integration tests, and end-to-end UI automation.

2. What is Being Tested
2.1 Application Under Test
Frontend: React-based web application for task management

Backend: Node.js/Express REST API with JWT authentication

Database: In-memory storage (for demo purposes)

Authentication: JWT-based login system

Core Features: CRUD operations for tasks, user authentication, task completion status

2.2 Test Scope
In Scope:

User authentication (login/logout)

Task management operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete)

Frontend-backend integration

API endpoint functionality

Form validations and error handling

Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome primary)

Responsive UI behavior

Out of Scope:

Performance testing

Security penetration testing

Database persistence testing

Mobile app testing

Load/stress testing

3. Test Coverage Areas
3.1 Functional Testing Areas
Test Area	Coverage	Test Type
Authentication	Valid/invalid login scenarios, JWT token validation, session management	API + UI
Task Management	CRUD operations, task completion, form validations	API + UI
User Interface	Form interactions, button functionality, dynamic updates	UI
API Endpoints	Request/response validation, error handling, status codes	API
Integration	Frontend-backend communication, data flow	E2E
3.2 Technical Coverage Areas
API Testing Coverage:

POST /login - Authentication endpoint

GET /tasks - Retrieve user tasks

POST /tasks - Create new task

PUT /tasks/:id - Update existing task

DELETE /tasks/:id - Delete task

Error handling for 400, 401, 403, 404, 500 status codes

UI Testing Coverage:

Login form validation

Task creation workflow

Task editing functionality

Task deletion with confirmation

Task completion toggle

Logout functionality

Error message display

4. Tools Used and Justification
4.1 API Testing Stack
Tool	Purpose	Justification
Jest	Test runner and assertion library	Built-in with Node.js, excellent mocking capabilities, coverage reporting
Supertest	HTTP assertion library	Seamless integration with Express, handles server lifecycle automatically
Why this combination:

Fast test execution (no browser overhead)

Comprehensive coverage reporting

Easy CI/CD integration

Industry standard for Node.js API testing

4.2 UI Testing Stack
Tool	Purpose	Justification
Selenium WebDriver	Browser automation	Cross-browser support, mature ecosystem, extensive documentation
Python	Test scripting language	Simple syntax, excellent Selenium bindings, rich testing ecosystem
pytest	Test runner	Powerful fixtures, detailed reporting, parallel execution support
Chrome WebDriver	Browser driver	Most commonly used browser, reliable automation support
Why this combination:

Real browser testing environment

Cross-platform compatibility

Comprehensive element interaction capabilities

Visual validation support

4.3 CI/CD Integration
Tool	Purpose	Justification
GitHub Actions	CI/CD pipeline	Free for public repos, excellent GitHub integration, parallel job execution
pytest-html	Test reporting	Detailed HTML reports with screenshots on failure
5. How to Run Tests
5.1 Prerequisites
bash
# System Requirements
- Node.js 18+
- Python 3.9+
- Chrome browser
- Git

# Project Setup
git clone <repository-url>
cd task-manager-project
5.2 Local Test Execution
Start Application Services:

bash
# Terminal 1: Backend API (Port 3001)
cd backend
npm install
npm run dev

# Terminal 2: Frontend React App (Port 3000)
cd frontend
npm install
npm start

# Terminal 3: Install Python dependencies
pip install -r tests/requirements.txt
Run API Tests:

bash
cd backend
npm test                    # Run all API tests
npm run test:coverage      # Run with coverage report
Run UI Tests:

bash
# Ensure both frontend and backend are running
python -m pytest tests/ui_tests.py -v                           # All UI tests
python -m pytest tests/ui_tests.py::TaskManagerUITests::test_01_login_with_valid_credentials -v  # Specific test
python -m pytest tests/ui_tests.py -v --html=report.html --self-contained-html  # With HTML report
Run Headless (CI Mode):

bash
HEADLESS=true python -m pytest tests/ui_tests.py -v
5.3 CI/CD Execution
Tests run automatically on:

Push to main or develop branches

Pull requests to main

Manual workflow dispatch

Pipeline Stages:

Backend Tests → API validation and unit tests

Frontend Tests → React component tests (if any)

UI Tests → End-to-end Selenium tests

Deployment → Automated deployment on success

CI/CD Environment:
- Configured automatically in GitHub Actions
7. Success Criteria
7.1 Test Pass Criteria
API Tests: 100% pass rate, >90% code coverage

UI Tests: 100% pass rate across all critical user journeys

Build Process: Successful compilation and deployment

Performance: All tests complete within 5 minutes

7.2 Quality Gates
Zero critical bugs in authentication flow

All CRUD operations function correctly

Proper error handling and user feedback

Cross-browser compatibility (Chrome validated)

8. Assumptions and Limitations
8.1 Assumptions
Environment: Application runs on localhost during testing

Data: In-memory storage resets between test runs

Browser: Chrome browser available for UI automation

Network: Stable internet connection for CI/CD

Concurrency: Single user session testing only

8.2 Current Limitations
Data Persistence: Tests use in-memory storage, no database integration testing

Authentication Model: Single user authentication, no role-based testing

Browser Coverage: Limited to Chrome (primary), Firefox available as fallback

Performance Testing: No load/stress testing included

Security Testing: Basic validation only, no penetration testing

Mobile Testing: Desktop-focused, responsive design not extensively tested

8.3 Risk Mitigation Strategies
Flaky Tests: Retry mechanisms and explicit waits implemented

Environment Issues: Multiple WebDriver fallback strategies

CI/CD Reliability: Parallel job execution with proper dependencies

Test Maintenance: Centralized element selectors and helper methods

8.4 Future Enhancements
Integration with database testing

Performance benchmarking

Extended cross-browser testing

Visual regression testing

API contract testing

Security vulnerability scanning

9. Reporting and Monitoring
9.1 Test Reports
API Tests: Jest coverage reports with lcov format

UI Tests: HTML reports with screenshots on failure

CI/CD: GitHub Actions workflow summaries

Coverage: Automated coverage reporting via Codecov integration

9.2 Failure Handling
Immediate Notifications: CI/CD failures reported via GitHub

Screenshots: Captured automatically on UI test failures

Logs: Detailed error logs preserved as artifacts

Retry Logic: Automatic retry for transient failures

Document Version: 1.0
